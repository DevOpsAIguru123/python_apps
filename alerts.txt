Datadog

Given your current Databricks monitoring setup with Datadog (including cluster/job monitoring, user activity, SQL queries, object usage, and DBU metrics), here are suggested alert types organized by category:

⸻

1. Cluster & Job Performance Alerts
	•	High Cluster CPU Utilization:
Condition: CPU usage > 85% for 10 mins.
	•	High Memory Usage:
Condition: Memory utilization > 85% for 10 mins.
	•	Long Job Runtime:
Condition: Job runtime exceeds historical average by >50%.
	•	Job Failure Rate:
Condition: Job failure rate increases above threshold (e.g., 5% failures in 24h).

⸻

2. Workspace User Activity Alerts
	•	Spike in Active Users:
Condition: Active user count increases significantly (e.g., 25% above daily average).
	•	Unauthorized Login Attempts:
Condition: Multiple failed login attempts from the same user or IP within a short period.
	•	Sudden Drop in User Activity:
Condition: Active users significantly drop (>40%) from historical weekly average.

⸻

3. SQL Query Execution Alerts
	•	Spike in SQL Query Volume:
Condition: Queries executed per hour > 50% above historical hourly average.
	•	High Query Latency:
Condition: Average SQL query latency > threshold (e.g., 2x average latency).
	•	High Query Failure Rate:
Condition: SQL query failure rate >5% within an hour.

⸻

4. Workspace Objects Monitoring
	•	Rapid Growth in Objects:
Condition: Sudden spike in number of tables, schemas, or volumes (>15% increase in a single day).
	•	Deletion of Critical Objects:
Condition: Alert immediately if critical schemas, catalogs, or volumes are deleted.
	•	Service Principals/Group Count Spike:
Condition: Sudden spike (>10%) in the count of service principals or groups.

⸻

5. Workspace DBU Usage Alerts
	•	Weekly DBU Spike:
Condition: Weekly DBU consumption >25% above average weekly consumption.
	•	Monthly DBU Usage Approaching Quota:
Condition: Monthly DBU usage reaches 80% of allocated DBU budget.
	•	Year-over-Year DBU Spike:
Condition: Current year’s DBU consumption exceeds previous year by significant margin (e.g., 20%).

⸻

6. Data Security and Governance
	•	Excessive Permissions Granted:
Condition: Elevated permissions granted frequently within short intervals.
	•	Unusual Data Access Patterns:
Condition: Sudden spike in access requests to sensitive schemas or tables.

⸻

Recommendations on Alert Severity:
	•	Critical Alerts:
Immediate actions required (e.g., cluster downtime, job failures, security risks).
	•	Warning Alerts:
Investigate promptly, may not immediately affect production.
	•	Informational Alerts:
Good to know but no immediate action (e.g., slight increase in usage, moderate fluctuations).

⸻

Additional Best Practices:
	•	Anomaly Detection:
Use Datadog’s built-in anomaly detection for auto-baseline thresholds.
	•	Auto-Remediation:
Consider integrating Datadog alerts with automation scripts or runbooks for immediate remediation.

These alerts help ensure proactive monitoring and quick response to potential issues, improving overall reliability and security of your Databricks environment.
